# Title: RealTimeBusTracker
### Description of the project: 
This is a project that was completed as part of the MITx Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp. This uses the mapbox API to showcase the different trolley stops in the 
San Diego Trolley Green Line.

### How to Run: 
1. Git Clone this Repository. 
2. Use your own API-Key in the index.js
3. Open the index.html file in your browser

### Roadmap of future improvements: 
- We should add labels of the stop name, longitude, latitude as we look
at each stop. 
- We should have a controller to go back and forth between stops
- We should have a line that shows the path from first stop to the end.
